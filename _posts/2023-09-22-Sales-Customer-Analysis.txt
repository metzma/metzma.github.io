In this project, our client asked for an interactive dashboard to provide an analysis on customer sales.  We built this dashboard in Power BI for easy consumption based on the client already currently having access to Power BI based on their tech stack.

# Project Overview  <a name="overview-main"></a>

### Context <a name="overview-context"></a>

As part of this project, we were contacted by a client to analyze customer data over a 3-year period.  The data provided started in 2014 and continued into 2016. The client has not expanded their product offerings since this data was collected.  They are looking to expand product offerings and discontinue product offerings as well as look to discontinue selling in certain geographical locations.  This analysis will allow them to better understand their customers and how they perform in key areas.

* Provide sales comparisons by product by year
* Provide profit analysis for this year vs the previous year

Based on our observations, we can provide the following insights for customers based on the sales data provided:
