# Project Overview  <a name="overview-main"></a>

### Context <a name="overview-context"></a>

As part of this project, we were contacted by a client to analyze customer data over a 3 year period.  The data provided started in 2014 and continued into 2016. The client has no expanded their product offerings since this data was collected.  They are looking to expand product offerings and discontinue product offerings as well as look to discontinue selling in certain geogrphical locations.  This analysis will allow them to better understand their customers and how they perform in key areas.
